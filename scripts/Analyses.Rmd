## Why do we monitor vegetation?  

- Many plant species respond quickly to land management actions   
- Serve as indicators of whether an area is moving in a more-or-less desirable direction 
- Inform us whether a management action needs to be abandoned, increased, or maintained  
- **Serve as the main constituent of habitat quality**  
- Note we will **not** cover demography today. 

## What variables are typically monitored? 

-  **Absolute & Relative Cover** *How much of an area has vegetation? How is cover distributed across species and functional groups?*  
  - preventing erosion, characterizing habitat.   
- **Abundance, Frequency, Density**  *Are individual plants becoming patchier in areas? Is the population declining?*  
  - Are actions too concentrated to microsites? Is a valuable resource declining?  
- **Diversity** *How are species in an area distributed? Is an area down to only a few species?*  
  - Overall ecosystem integrity, assessing conservation priorities.   


## How do we measure plant cover?

- Depends on vegetation type, and annual climatic variability 

- Forest  
  - Line Intercept 
- Grassland & Savannah  
  - Line Intercept  (LI)  
  - Line-Point Intercept (LPI)  
  - (Historic) Daubenmire  
- Small plants!  
  - Grids with equal area cells  
  - most subjective of the methods  
  - very complicated by when sampling takes place  

## How do we measure plant abundance, frequency, and density? 

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;"> 
- Belt Transects (abundance)  
  - plants are very sparse - pop. census size  
  - set up around LPI transects  
- Nested Quadrats (frequency)  
  - monitor multiple species simultaneously - spatial distribution / stability of populations  
  - Daubenmire frames also used  
- Quadrats (density)  
  - plants are moderately abundant - pop. census size,  spatial distribution

</div> 

## How do we measure diversity? 

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;"> 
- Can be done by wandering around areas... 
- Quadrats   
  - Generally *much* larger than in other types of sampling  
  - Fewer replicates  
- Need to be orientated to cross along environmental gradients   
- The gold standard: Modified Whittaker
  - MW has two less intensive follow-up variants, the 'Intensive' and 'Extensive' 
  - I&E plots can characterize microhabitats (use determined via rarefaction)  
  - takes a long time...

## What is Floristic Quality? 
<font size="4">

> _'... tolerance of anthropogenic disturbance and exclusivity to remnant habitats are the only validated criteria for deﬁning FQA.'_
> 

> _'...FQA conveys two things about high conservative species: (1) All else being equal, they have greater conservation value, and (2) they reﬂect a site’s history of minimal disturbance and degradation.'_
>
> `r tufte::quote_footer('--- Spyreas 2019')`

</font>

- Useful for identifying high-quality remnant habitat  
- Essentially a format for prioritizing land management decisions, especially active management 
- We know we cannot restore everywhere, preventing degradation is key, we can shift certain activities to areas of less conservation values  

## What do C-values mean? 

- Vary by each administrative unit they are generated for  
- Reflect the *purpose* of monitoring  

<font size="4">

> _'... the coefficient applied to each taxon represents a rank based on observed
behavior and patterns of occurrence in Illinois plant communities and our confidence that a taxon is remnant
(natural area) dependent._   

> _Species given a C value of **0-1** are taxa adapted to severe disturbances, particularly
anthropogenic disturbances..._   

> _Species with a C value of **2-3** are associated with somewhat more stable, though degraded,
environments._   

> _Species with coefficients **4-6** include many dominant or matrix species for several habitats;
they have a high consistency of occurrence within given community types._ 

> _Species with C values **7-8** are taxa we associate mostly with natural areas, but that can be found persisting where the habitat has been degraded somewhat._    

> _Species with coefficients **9-10** are considered to be restricted to high-quality natural areas.'_

## What do we mean by Species Richness? 

- The number of plant taxa in an area; also referred to as gamma-diversity  
- Measuring it can be difficult, as many plants are locally rare  
- Gamma-diversity, and it's measurement, is influenced by two main traits 
  - the number of species per sub-habitats (alpha-diversity)    
  - the turnover in species between sub-habitats (beta-diversity) 

## Plot Layout 

- Species Richness  
  - Rectangular plots capture more species (reviewed in Elzinga et al. 2001)  
    - Cross more micro-habitats  
- Species Abundance  
  - Foliar cover / Basal Cover  
    - How much 
  - Indicator species, frequency of certain grass species; nested quadrats
    - strength of frequency: unlikely to vary via climate or grazing

## Reading Plots  
- Boundary Decisions  
  - Are plants rooted?  
  - Which side of the plots are plant rooted in?  
- Order to reading?   
  - Nested quadrats go from smallest to largest plot  
    - Only record *new* species along the way  
    - If same species is present in '2' as in '1' do not record.  
- Avoiding double counting  
  - search methodically following a single direction  
  - Avoid trampling  

## Management Decisions - Species Richness

- Ecosystem resilience often found to relate to the number of species in an area  
  - Loss of species may allow proliferation of invasive species  

## Management Decisions - FQA  

- Should areas with more remnant species be prioritized for active management? *and why* 
  - Some species cannot be 'added' back in via restoration  
  - These areas maybe managed to reduce further anthropogenic impacts, e.g. invasive removal, disallow certain recreation activities. 
  - Some areas with higher C-values likely to still harbor rare-species, impetus to survey. 

- Use Mean C, or FQI to detect these areas.  

## Management Decisions - Species Cover 

- Cover of species naturally ebb and flow  
- Certain management actions can increase cover of some species, while vastly decreasing cover of others  
- Many of the decreasing species may be important for wildlife, or ecosystem function (e.g. water retention, soil stability)  

## Management Decisions - Vegetation Similarity 

- If we want to *restore* an area, what target area should we use to guide our decisions?  
- Can we expect areas with similar vegetation to respond similarly to management actions? 
  - e.g. fire, grazing cattle/sheep/goats, removal of invasives? 

## Do people really do this?  

- Yes, see Benkendorf & Holsinger 2023 for a real life example  
  - They use plot based species richness data to determine which factors most affect status of natural areas  
  - ca. 860,000 acre area, use spatial statistics and regression techniques to identify features correlating with high FQI  
  - Decision: 
    - Do we restore areas at less than 7,000 feet? 
    - Or do we climate proof ourselves and focus higher?  
  - Surprising finding
    - Areas near human habitation doing pretty well...  

## Our activity for the early afternoon

- Compare two different parts of McDonald Woods, Upland White Oak & Swamp White Oak  
- 1) Determine whether they have different FQI, Mean C, and Wetland Status scores  
- 2) Determine how well our quadrats capture the species richness   
- 3) Are any portions of each site more similar to the portions of the opposite site?   

## Analyses 

- `r paste0('Carried out in ', R.version$version.string, ' on ', R.version$os)`  
- **iNEXT** (Chao et al. 2014, Hsieh et al. 2024) for rarefaction, used to assess sampling completeness.   
- **rstatix** (Kassambara 2024) for t.test, used to determine whether differences exist between sites.  
- **vegan** (Oksanen et al. 2024) for Non-metric multiDimensional Scaling (NMDS), are portions of sites more similar to each other 

```{r Prep data for analyses}

```

## Analysis 1 - Are we capturing a representative amount of the species diversity? 

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">  
- Not all species are equally common, and detection of locally rare species is difficult  
- We can assess sampling completion using rarefaction, and random shuffling of plots  
- If the number of species (Y axis), increase greatly via extrapolation, then we should sample more plots

## Analysis 2 - Are the two sites notably different? 

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;"> 
- FQI reflects the history of disturbance at a site, the sites disturbance histories vary  
- Hypothesis: the *Swamp white Oak section* has less historic anthropogenic disturbance  
- Null Hypothesis: the FQI of the two sites do not differ  
- Two-sided Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, data are unpaired   
- Easy method: compare the central tendency of all quadrats per site

## Analysis 3 - What Quadrat size can we use to determine frequency of indicator species? 

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;"> 
- It can be difficult to determine the appropriate plot size for monitoring species  
- Nests allow us to try different options readily  
- For expedited monitoring carried out across large domains, finding an optimal size is important  
- We want a species to show up in 20-80% of plots of various sizes  
- our data are pilot data for future monitoring

## Analysis 4 - Are certain microhabits more similar *across* than between sites? 

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;"> 
- Some plots may have more similarities to plots at the other site  
- This may indicate each site has pockets in similar states
